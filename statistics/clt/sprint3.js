question[currentProblem]='Times for NAIA male sprinters in the 100m in a recent season had a mean of 11.31 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.37 seconds.<p> \
Assume that these times are normally distributed.  What is the probability that a random sample of 8 NAIA male sprinters have an average time less than 11.35 seconds? \
