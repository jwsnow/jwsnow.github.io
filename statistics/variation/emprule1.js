question[currentProblem]='NAIA women\'s times in the 100m during a recent season had an average of 13.31 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.87 seconds.  Use this information and the Empirical Rule to find an interval of times the includes about 68% of the women\'s times.<br><br> \
Find the lower limit of the interval. (Round to two decimal places as necessary.)';
type[currentProblem]='N';
answer[currentProblem]='12.44';
hint[currentProblem]='The Empirical Rule says that in many types of data about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean.  About 95% is within two standard deviations, and about 99.7 is within three standard deviations.';
