question[currentProblem]='When a fair coin is flipped, the result is either an H or a T.  Such a coin is flipped three times.  The sample space of all possible outcomes is: <br><br> {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT} <br><br>  If we know that there is at least one T, then what is the probability that there are at least two Ts?<br> (Write your answer as a fraction or as a decimal rounded to three decimal places.)';
type[currentProblem]='N';
answer[currentProblem]='4/7';
hint[currentProblem]='Count the number of ways in which the desired event can occur.  Then divide by the total number of events.';
