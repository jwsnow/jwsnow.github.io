		<ul>
		<li><a href="texts/Analysis.pdf" target="NEW"><i>An Introduction to Real Analysis</i></a><p>This text gives a rigorous but streamlined development of sequences, limits, derivatives, integrals, and series for a one-semester undergraduate course in Analysis.</p></li>
		<li><a href="texts/IntroToMath.pdf" target="NEW"><i>An Introduction to Mathematics</i></a><p>This text is designed for a collaborative learning introduction to logic, sets, cardinality, and proof writing.</p></li>
		<li><a href="texts/Logic.pdf" target="NEW"><i>Symbolic Logic</i></a><p>This is a symbolic logic text developed for philosophy minors. It introduces students with no background to propositional logic, predicate logic, soundness, completeness, set theory, cardinality, incompleteness, and computability.</p></li>
		<li><a href="texts/Geometry.pdf" target="NEW"><i>Geometry</i></a><p>This is a Moore Method type theorem sequence for a course in geometry.  The sequence begins with incidence axioms and proofs as much as is reasonably possible before introducing measurement and then parallel postulates.</p></li>
		<li><a href="texts/Discrete.pdf" target="NEW"><i>Discrete Mathematics</i></a><p>These notes are the beginning of a non-proof-based discrete mathematics course for freshmen with no background.</p></li>
		<li><a href="texts/MET.pdf" target="NEW"><i>Mathematics for Elementary Teachers</i></a><p>These are notes for a mathematics course for future elementary teachers. The notes attempt to balance the constructive, problem solving nature of mathematics with the level of students often found in this class.</p></li>
